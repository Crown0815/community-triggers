# Hide Microsoft Teams

This work is based on "Hide Slack"

This trigger will hide the `Microsoft Teams (work or school).app` automatically when you share your display.

This can be handy to save you from showing private conversations or sensitive information.

> Bear in mind that this trigger should only work for the "new" version of Microsoft Teams, named "Microsoft Teams (work or school)"

If you're executing this trigger for the first time, `System Events` may prompt you for permission.
