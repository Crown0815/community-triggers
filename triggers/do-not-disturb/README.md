# Do Not Disturb

Enable the Do Not Disturb focus mode when on a call.

This trigger requires that you configure two "shortcuts" in the macOS Shortcuts app.

The first should be named `dnd-on`, and it should turn the Do Not Disturb focus mode "on" until "Turned Off".

The other should be named `dnd-off`, and it should turn the Do Not Disturb focus mode "off".
